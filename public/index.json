However, compared to the effects of shape, size, and color, the effect of orientation is rather small. We examined a potential explanation for the relatively low magnitude of the orientation effect: object size moderates the orientation effect. Theoretical considerations led us to predict a smaller orientation effect for small objects than for large objects in a sentence-picture verification task. We furthermore investigated whether this pattern generalizes across languages (Chinese, Dutch, and English) and tasks (picture- naming task). The results of the verification task show an orientation effect overall, which is not moderated by object size (contrary to our hypothesis) and language (consistent with our hypothesis). Meanwhile the preregistered picture-picture verification task showed the predicted interaction between object size and orientation effect. We conducted exploratory analyses to address additional questions.","tags":["PDF"],"title":"Does Object Size Matter with Regard to the Mental Simulation of Object Orientation?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543536000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543536000,"objectID":"62d888116f5b6178cc841499067bb166","permalink":"/project/mental_simulation/","publishdate":"2018-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mental_simulation/","section":"project","summary":"Investigating the mental simulation of object orientation across languages and cultures.","tags":["mental simulation","reading sentence"],"title":"Orientation Effects across Languages","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Teaching","Practices"],"content":"\rTwenty years ago 11-years-old Emily Rosa and her parents publsihed their study in Journal of the American Medical Association. This study was designed by Emily herself two years before the publication. Before 1998, Therapeutic Touch (commonly shortened to “TT”) had been advocated in hundreds of hospitals and nursing schools in North America. Forty thousands of health care professionals had been trained to use TT for their patient. The trained TT professionals were claimed, by the promoters, have the skill to manipulate the energy field surrounded human body without touching. TT professionals just stoped the plams above the patients’ body for minutes to cure their pain and anxiety. However, the evidence about the reality of TT was vague.\nEmily was curious how real was TT technique. To test their skill under unbiased observations, she designed the test table like the below figure shows. Every trainee would run 10 trials in one test. In each trial, Emily placed her right hand above one of the participated trainee’ hand, decided by flipped coin. She had the hypothesis if the skill of TT trainees was real, they would give the correct answers in at least 8 of the trials.\nEmily ran this study two times between 1996 and 1997. At the first time 15 TT trainees were invited to this study. She deiced to run the second time after the TV station interviewed her. At the second time 13 TT trainees, included 7 had participated in the first time, joined this study. Their analysis showed the average accuracy of these trainees as equal to the random guessing.\n\rWe would learn many things from Emily’s study till today. First of all the critical finding was the null effect. Today the behavioral scientists share more attention about the null effect than 1998. The other interesting thing is that the prediction could be verified by one point. It is rare to use the one-sample t-test in the psychological studies, but almost every psychologist learned the one-sample t-test before the independent t-test and paired t-test. Latest but may be critical, the idea of little Emily embodied the statistical thinking.\nEmily’s data were summarized in the reproduced figure as below. They ran the one-sample t-test for the results of two times respectively. The analyses disconfirmed the reality of TT technique, but Emily and her parents might show a kind of researcher flexibility: they used the small samples in their first and follow-up studies. Could we upgrade their results in addition to conduct a registered replication plan?\n\rFigure 1: Reproductive test results of Rosa et al.(1998)\r\rIf Emily had learned Bayesian statistics in 1998, she would show the reporters her stronger belief how fake the TT technique was. Next, I use the binomial probability distribution to reanalyze Emily’s data in the simple Bayesian inference. My first step is the recovery of the original correct frequency of every TT participant. Although Emily’s paper gave the range of scores (initial study: 2 to 8; follow-up study: 1 to 7), they did not provide the how many correct trials conducted by every participant. I arranged the numbers based on the averages and number of total correct responses as follows:\n(R-chunk, vectors of numbers)\n# Initial test data\rData_initial \u0026lt;- c(2,3,3,3,3,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,7,8)\r# Follow-up data\rData_followup \u0026lt;- c(1,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,7,7)\rThen I required the theoretical parameters representing Emily’s hypothesis. Her study in nature was a game of coin tossing. She assumed certificated TT participants, given their technique was real, could answer correctly in more than 8 trials. In the other word, among the ten coins flipped by Emily, they could look into which 8, 9, or all sides on the top. Before the initial study, Emily could assume the probability each participant give the correct answer in a trial to be more than 0.5. If she used Bayesian inference, she would expect the posterior probability higher than 0.8. Therefore I prepared the uniform distribution ranged between 0.5 and 1 as the prior probability of the Bayesian inference.\nIt was recorded that only one participant returned 8 correct answers in the initial study. My Bayesian model used the binomial distribution with the arguments of 10 trials and prior probabilities. This model generated the posterior probability distribution given the data of Emily’s initial study. The average of the initial study was 4.67; thus I retrieved the posterior probability distribution of 5 from the Bayesian model.\n(R-chunk, Bayesian model and posterior histogram of initial)\r\rFigure 2: Bayesian inferece of initial study: Prior probability distribution (y axis) and Conditioning correct frequencies (x axis)\r\r\rFigure 3: Posterior probability distribution of initial study result\r\rAccording to the posterior probability distribution of the initial study, the probability of TT trainees returned more than 8 correct answers would be 0.03. Because Emily had never considered the reproduction of her initial study before the interview, the follow-up study was like the second chance for the TT trainees. After the initial study, Emily updated her assumption of how many correct answers TT trainees could return in this study. I used the posterior probability distribution of the initial study as the prior probabilities for the analysis of the follow-up study. Then I built the Bayesian model and retrieved the posterior probability distribution given the average 4.06, I truncated to 4.\n(R-chunk, Bayesian model and posterior histogram of follow-up)\r\rFigure 4: Bayesian inferece of follow-up study: Prior probability distribution (y axis) and Conditioning correct frequencies (x axis)\r\r\rFigure 5: Posterior probability distribution of follow-up study result\r\rThe histogram of the posterior probability distribution shows zero possibility beyond 8. My reanalysis indicates that Emily’s study indeed falsified the reality of Therapeutic Touch. You may wonder if people have updated the understanding of Therapeutic Touch because of Emily’s study. Till today the official website of Therapeutic Touch is regularly upgrading the latest information. More efforts are required to guide people thinking this world with scientific and statistical knowledge.\n","date":1534204800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534204800,"objectID":"5af66f8ec8f5ee1684b60bb8c077ca07","permalink":"/post/if-emily-rosa-met-thomas-bayes/","publishdate":"2018-08-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/if-emily-rosa-met-thomas-bayes/","section":"post","summary":"Reanalysis of the study conducted by a young girl two decades ago.

When I met papaja(Aust and Barth 2017) three years ago, it is my dream someday I will use R(R Development Core Team 2010) process all my works. papaja is amazing but it is implemented to English only. Later I found bookdown developed by Yihui Xie(Xie 2017). bookdown has the potential to manage Chinese writings. However, this package is primarily developed for writing and publishing books.\nFortunately, Peng Zhao has worked on the advanced work: bookdownplus(Zhao 2017). This package provides many templates for a couple of academic works and hobbies. According to the help file, there are academic article, book, thesis, poster, and journals. Because of Zhao’s interests, the users could write and publish poem book and guitar chords. The following pictures are the outcomes of these templates:\nI believe ‘journal’ will be the hottest templaters for many research teams who are running their open practices. All the members of a project will have managed their daily journals collaboratively. The journal could be opened to public after the final paper is formly published.\nFor the users who read and write traditional Chiense like me, you have to install some font files after you completed the install work flow as the mannual. According to my tests in WINDOWS 10, The font files are KaiTi.ttf, simfang.ttf, simhei.ttf, and simkai.ttf. Then you can use the Chinese templates in bookdownplus.\nIn future, I wish bookdownplus could enhance the support for many multi-bytes language systems. The users could provide and share the customed templates through the updates.

You may not need the backticks if your math expression does not contain any special Markdown syntax such as underscores or asterisks, but it is always a safer choice to use backticks.

This paper is published in 1956 in the Dutch journal Nederlands Tijdschrift voor de Psychologie en Haar Grensgebieden. Adrianus De Groot is Dutch psychologist and chess master. During 1950s and 1960s, he suggested the concept of emperical cycle for the researchers who use the statistical tools in the social and behavioral researches.\nEmperical cycle\n\rde Groot’s emperical cycle distinguish two types of emperical research: exploratory research and confirmatory research. Exploratory research aims to formulate the hypotheses that covers the process from observation to induction. Confirmatory research attempts to test the predicited concequences based the hypothesis. Thus a Confirmatory research covers deduction, testing, and evaluation.\nIn the time de Groot started his academic career, the protocol of hypothesis testing has been completed by the leading statisticans, Ronald Fisher, Jerzy Neyman, and Egon Pearson. Psychologists at that time learned and used p value to evaluate the results. de Groot in his paper has suggested that the hypothesis testing is the appropriate tool to evaluate the result of a confirmatory reserach. He in the same paper also discussed the problems that perhapes happen when the hypothesis testing was used to decide the available hypotheses in an exploratory research. There are two cases of explorartoy research discussed in his paper. One has finite hypotheses, and the other has infinite hypotheses. Both cases show up in front of every researcher in anytime and in anywhere. Many researcher struggle how to pick the available hypotheses up according to the data in hands.\nExploratory research has finite hypotheses\rThe section title in de Groot’s paper is Hypothesis testing research for multiple hypotheses. He presumed the case as follow:\nWe give N as the number of hypotheses yet to be tested. Every hypothesis is going to be evaluated by the hypothesis testing. We also give n as the number of hypothese successfully passed the test. Every hypothesis have the probability .05 pass the test. This probability refers to the type 1 error in the present hypothesis testing.\nToday we have 10 hypotheses (N = 10) to be evaluated by the data. Consider all the consequences, we can calculate all the probabilities given the counts of positive hypotheses.\nrequire(xtable)\rN \u0026lt;- 10\rn \u0026lt;- 0:10\ralpha \u0026lt;- .05\rREJECT_P \u0026lt;- 0\rPASS_P \u0026lt;- rep(0,length(n))\rfor(k in n){\rREJECT_P = REJECT_P + choose(N,k)*alpha^k*(1 - alpha)^(N - k) PASS_P[k+1] = 1 - REJECT_P\r}\rSUCCESS = data.frame(n,PASS_P)\rcolnames(SUCCESS) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;n\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Probability(Positive Results)\u0026quot;)\rprint(xtable(SUCCESS), include.rownames = FALSE, type = \u0026quot;html\u0026quot; ) \r\r\rn\r\r\rProbability(Positive Results)\r\r\r\r0\r\r0.40\r\r\r\r1\r\r0.09\r\r\r\r2\r\r0.01\r\r\r\r3\r\r0.00\r\r\r\r4\r\r0.00\r\r\r\r5\r\r0.00\r\r\r\r6\r\r0.00\r\r\r\r7\r\r0.00\r\r\r\r8\r\r0.00\r\r\r\r9\r\r0.00\r\r\r\r10\r\r0.00\r\r\r\rplot(PASS_P ~ n, xlab = \u0026quot;Smallest Number of Positive Hypotheses\u0026quot;, ylab = \u0026quot;Probability(Positive Results)\u0026quot;)\rThat table is telling us if we wish acquire at least one positive hypothesis, the probability is 0.4012631. That plot shows the probability dramatically decrease with the increasing numbers in our wish. In other words, when we have no precise knowlegde about the use of hyphtesis testing, the more hypotheses we want to induce, the higher risk we get nothing.\n\rExploratory research has infinite hypotheses\rThis case is everywhere in this era of big data. de Groot called this case Material-exploration: N becomes unspeciﬁed. In his paper, material refers to data because data is a low frequency word in his era. The researchers in his era has realized the best way to deal with this case is to let the data tell the story. The research on this case obviously is an exploratory research. For the researchers in de Groot’s era and in the era of big data, there are two routes to finish this kind of research project. One route is to label and categorize the hypotheses. This route is the hot topic of machine learning in the present data science. The other route is to decide the possible hypotheses. Today the researchers on this route mostly rely on the multiple variate statistical tools.\nde Groot suggests the caution to the research that attempts to decide the potential hypotheses. N is infinite because not all hypotheses could be induced in this case. Whe we have 20 testable hypotheses from 200 potential hypotheses. If a researcher confirmed that 10 of the 20 hypotheses have the positive support by the data, based on the type 1 error, he/she has to understand that 5% hypotheses are positive (10/200) but 50% hypotheses are positive (10/20). This caution is like the misuse of golem that is discussed in Statistical Rethingking. In the timing I am writing this note, this caution implied the researchers who are thinking the potential hypotheses are decided assumed that they have finished a emperical circle.\n\rRole of Preregisteration\rDecades of misusing the hypothesis testing have resulted in a bad situation we have to faced. There is no clear cutoff between the exploratory research and the confirmatory research. Many published papers in nature are the exploratory researches, but they are packaged in the form of confirmatory research by the authors (editors and reviewers have the responsibility too). This is why de Groot’s originated paper was translated and published 60 years later. This post is one of the fundemental I will cite when I introduce and discuss the preregistration.\n\r","date":1462406400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462406400,"objectID":"96729e3f391aa612342173e37a622bd6","permalink":"/post/2016-05-05-rethink-significance/","publishdate":"2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-05-05-rethink-significance/","section":"post","summary":"Visualized my thinking about p values.","tags":["preregistration","R_programming","Rethinking","statistics"],"title":"Rethink Significance","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Practices"],"content":"\rChapter 2 of Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan introduces a water tossing example for the demonstration how Bayesain model run through the data based on the researcher’s hypothesis. This chapter defines a three stage process that are used in the coming chapters. We start from a narrated Data Story, then update the models by filling data in, and finally evaluate all the upated models. This literated process shows a clear picture for the learners who have yet stuied statistics before read this book. The readers who have studied statistics, like me, will have a hole in the mind what are the differences between Bayesian methods and the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) in this process. After read Michael Clark’s Bayesian Basics: A Conceptual Introduction with Application in R and Stan on Stan official site, I require the key to understand the difference between the two golems.\nThe critical difference is which type of conditional probability the statistical method is used to evaluate the model. Once we collected the data based on some hypothesis, we have the distribution of hypothesis $ p( ) $ and the distribution of data $ p(y) $. NHST compuates the probability we have the data when the hypothesis is true $ p(y|) $. In practical, p value refers to the conditional probability of the null hypothesis, and * confidence interval* suggests a range of plausible outcomes based on the confiditional probability of the real hypothesis. A Bayesian method compuates the probability the hypothesis is approved based on the data we have $ p(|y) $. Because the computation of $ p(|y) $ needs the likelihood $ p(y|) $ and the priori $ p() $, of course a Baysian method cost more steps than NHST.\n$ $ has a term parameter in many statstical textbooks. It is a space of numbers that provides the axis where the above probability distribution sit on. Likelihood is the sampling distribution we have to update before we run NHST. As like I show in Learning Sampling Distribution in R Programming, a sampling distribution will approach one $ $ with the increasing sample size. Sample size is the key for NHST because it could change the evaluation criteron on the statistical model.\nHere is a pseudo experiment I want to know if a test is success based on the expect value smaller than 5 (Obersvations are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). I completed an experiment of 25 observations and an experiment 36 observations. In use of NHST with a critical value (p \u0026lt; .05), the criterion change with the sample size. The simulation\nset.seed(1)\rOBV \u0026lt;- 1:10\rDist25 \u0026lt;- NULL\rDist36 \u0026lt;- NULL\rcount = 100\rwhile(count \u0026gt; 0){Dist25 \u0026lt;- c(Dist25,mean(sample(OBV, 25,replace = TRUE) ) ); count \u0026lt;- count - 1}\rDist25_Density \u0026lt;- data.frame(Theta = density(Dist25, kernel = \u0026quot;gaussian\u0026quot;)$x, Density = density(Dist25, kernel = \u0026quot;gaussian\u0026quot;)$y)\rCL25 \u0026lt;- max(Dist25_Density$Theta[Dist25_Density$Theta \u0026lt; 5 \u0026amp; Dist25_Density$Density \u0026lt; .05])\rprint(CL25) ## The smallest parameter that could make judgement\r## [1] 4.286263\rcount = 100\rwhile(count \u0026gt; 0){Dist36 \u0026lt;- c(Dist36,mean(sample(OBV, 36,replace = TRUE) ) ); count \u0026lt;- count - 1}\rDist36_Density \u0026lt;- data.frame(Theta = density(Dist36, kernel = \u0026quot;gaussian\u0026quot;)$x, Density = density(Dist36, kernel = \u0026quot;gaussian\u0026quot;)$y)\rCL36 \u0026lt;- max(Dist36_Density$Theta[Dist36_Density$Theta \u0026lt; 5 \u0026amp; Dist36_Density$Density \u0026lt; .05])\rprint(CL36) ## The smallest parameter that could make judgement\r## [1] 4.345472\rWhen this experiment outputs a avarage value between 4.15 and 4.42, would you like to collect the data more than 36 participants? This is the opportunity many researchers have to struggle in their study. Researchers who are educated as like me used to collect the observation till the p value is smaller than .05. Most researchers used to stop the experiment till the 36th participant finished the experiment. However, this treatment lacks of the serious scientific thinking. If the hypothesis has set up the conditions to have the average, the sample size should be appointed before the start of experiment.\nThe appointment of sample size could be loose when the possible average is uncertain. When the experiment is conducted at first time in the world, NHST without the appointment of sample size could draw the range of averages that might obey the hypothesis. On the other hand, the following studies better has the appointment of sample size. In this case, NHST has to accompany the other statistical evaluation, such as power, effect size, to find the appropriate sample size. Therefore, NHST will perform well when the researcher conducted the first study or have the preparation as well as the first study. This will be the key in my autopsy of Bayesian method.\n","date":1461974400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461974400,"objectID":"0bf8fd0a3b064a2ea563ce57f79f329c","permalink":"/post/2016-04-30-autopsy-of-nhst-and-bayesian-models/","publishdate":"2016-04-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-04-30-autopsy-of-nhst-and-bayesian-models/","section":"post","summary":"My short note when I was learning Bayesian statistics.","tags":["Bayesian","Rethinking","statistics"],"title":"Autopsy of NHST and Bayesian Models (part 1)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Practices"],"content":"\rSince two weeks before I published this post, I have started read the book Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan written by Richard McElreath. Richard is the evolutionary anthropologist at Max Planck Institute. He wrote this textbook for the PhD students who will use the Bayesian statistics in their research projects. Compared to the textbooks written by statisians and data scientistst, Richard’s book explain and demonstrate the statistical methods with examples instead of equations. His intention is to help who are not staticians but used to use statistics realize one fact: we rely on the statistical models as the representations of our answers rather than answer the questions by the raw data or naked truth. Many non-statisticians are used to find and learn what kind of methods or apps to deal with their data, but few are interested to know the models under the mentods and apps they are using. The trouble and danger is that they thought their jobs are done when the program printed the tables and figures but these outputs are from the statistical model is unable to answer their question. This situation is originated from many non-statisticans consider themselves the end-users of statistical models. Like any user of a packaged software, non-statisticans have no time to understand how the tools in their hands designed and conducted by statisticans.\nRichard introduced the story of golem to raise the non-statsiticans’ attention to the troubles they had made and will make. A statistical model, like a golem, has the power beyond human to finish the work the human are unable to do, for example, trace the passengers’ track from the trillion of camera. Its power could be misused or out of control if we do not understand what is the root of its action. A user of ststistical method, no matter you are or are not stistician, have to keep the awareness of engineer when you are dealing with your data. Today everyone has many easier ways than a decade ago to keep the awareness of engineer. One advantage is that the learning curve for being an part-time hacker is getting smooth. Increasing R apps are opening many windows for who are want to outlook and modify the statistical models.\nSince this post, every post listed in the category Rethinking is one of the summaries and feedbacks to Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan. At first I have to check my toolkits for create and manipulate the statistical models. They are R core and the packages. Years ago I have used to use the packages in my data processing. Now I show them for who start to use R after read this post.\ninstall.packages(c(\u0026quot;rpart\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;chron\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Hmisc\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Design\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Matrix\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;stringr\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;lme4\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;coda\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;e1071\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;zipfR\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;ape\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;languageR\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;multcomp\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;contrast\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shiny\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;ggplot2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;dplyr\u0026quot;))\rSome of the packages are learned from I participated in Cousera Data Science.

Do a simulation work is the best way to understand the sampling distribution. A simulation work is unrelated to any context we collect the data. You can connect the simulation work to any randominzation in the real world.\nIn this pseudo experiment, there are only ten observations we will collect in every sample. They are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Accodring to the design of the experiment, a sample will have one observation to countless observations. I assume the distrubtions are accumulated from 100 samples of 1 observation, 9 observations, ,16 observations, 25 observations, and 36 observations. Every sample will be collapsed to a average value and become the components of sampling distribution. I use ggplot2 to draw the five sampling distributions.
