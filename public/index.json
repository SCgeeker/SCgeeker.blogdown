You will find the articles and blog posts about my research that are going to be updated.\nSince 2017, I joined Psychological Science Accelerator and contributed the object orientation effects across languages as one of the initial collaborative research projects. To practice what I have learned from The Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science, I am managing the podcast open cafe and running the community Taiwan Collaboration for Psychological Scientific Research. Both projects aim to ground the open and reproducible sciences in Taiwan and Chinese-speaking societies. Till 2021, I am participating in the operations of Psychological Science Accelerator and The Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science as the associative director and executive commitee.\nThis website is updated based on my knowledge about data science. The data of the previous website are stored on this repository. Since 2017, I have participated in COS Ambassador project and registered the membership of The Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS). This experience truns me out the interests to evaluate and improve the quality of psycholinguistic researches. I am developing the Chinese tutorial of open sciences and registered reports.

However, compared to the effects of shape, size, and color, the effect of orientation is rather small. We examined a potential explanation for the relatively low magnitude of the orientation effect: object size moderates the orientation effect. Theoretical considerations led us to predict a smaller orientation effect for small objects than for large objects in a sentence-picture verification task. We furthermore investigated whether this pattern generalizes across languages (Chinese, Dutch, and English) and tasks (picture- naming task). The results of the verification task show an orientation effect overall, which is not moderated by object size (contrary to our hypothesis) and language (consistent with our hypothesis). Meanwhile the preregistered picture-picture verification task showed the predicted interaction between object size and orientation effect. We conducted exploratory analyses to address additional questions.","tags":["PDF"],"title":"Does Object Size Matter with Regard to the Mental Simulation of Object Orientation?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

This study was designed by Emily herself two years before the publication. Before 1998, Therapeutic Touch (commonly shortened to \u0026ldquo;TT\u0026rdquo;) had been advocated in hundreds of hospitals and nursing schools in North America. Forty thousands of health care professionals had been trained to use TT for their patient. The trained TT professionals were claimed, by the promoters, have the skill to manipulate the energy field surrounded human body without touching. TT professionals just stoped the plams above the patients' body for minutes to cure their pain and anxiety. However, the evidence about the reality of TT was vague.\nEmily was curious how real was TT technique. To test their skill under unbiased observations, she designed the test table like the below figure shows. Every trainee would run 10 trials in one test. In each trial, Emily placed her right hand above one of the participated trainee' hand, decided by flipped coin. She had the hypothesis if the skill of TT trainees was real, they would give the correct answers in at least 8 of the trials.\nEmily ran this study two times between 1996 and 1997. At the first time 15 TT trainees were invited to this study. She deiced to run the second time after the TV station interviewed her. At the second time 13 TT trainees, included 7 had participated in the first time, joined this study. Their analysis showed the average accuracy of these trainees as equal to the random guessing.\n  We would learn many things from Emily\u0026rsquo;s study till today. First of all the critical finding was the null effect. Today the behavioral scientists share more attention about the null effect than 1998. The other interesting thing is that the prediction could be verified by one point. It is rare to use the one-sample t-test in the psychological studies, but almost every psychologist learned the one-sample t-test before the independent t-test and paired t-test. Latest but may be critical, the idea of little Emily embodied the statistical thinking.\nEmily\u0026rsquo;s data were summarized in the reproduced figure as below. They ran the one-sample t-test for the results of two times respectively. The analyses disconfirmed the reality of TT technique, but Emily and her parents might show a kind of researcher flexibility: they used the small samples in their first and follow-up studies. Could we upgrade their results in addition to conduct a registered replication plan?\nFigure 1: Reproductive test results of Rosa et al.(1998)\n\rIf Emily had learned Bayesian statistics in 1998, she would show the reporters her stronger belief how fake the TT technique was. Next, I use the binomial probability distribution to reanalyze Emily\u0026rsquo;s data in the simple Bayesian inference. My first step is the recovery of the original correct frequency of every TT participant. Although Emily\u0026rsquo;s paper gave the range of scores (initial study: 2 to 8; follow-up study: 1 to 7), they did not provide the how many correct trials conducted by every participant. I arranged the numbers based on the averages and number of total correct responses as follows:\n(R-chunk, vectors of numbers)\n# Initial test data\rData_initial \u0026lt;- c(2,3,3,3,3,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,7,8)\r# Follow-up data\rData_followup \u0026lt;- c(1,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,7,7)\r Then I required the theoretical parameters representing Emily\u0026rsquo;s hypothesis. Her study in nature was a game of coin tossing. She assumed certificated TT participants, given their technique was real, could answer correctly in more than 8 trials. In the other word, among the ten coins flipped by Emily, they could look into which 8, 9, or all sides on the top. Before the initial study, Emily could assume the probability each participant give the correct answer in a trial to be more than 0.5. If she used Bayesian inference, she would expect the posterior probability higher than 0.8. Therefore I prepared the uniform distribution ranged between 0.5 and 1 as the prior probability of the Bayesian inference.\n# Study parameters\rn_TT \u0026lt;- 10000\rn_trials \u0026lt;- 10\r# Theoretical accuracies\rmin_acc \u0026lt;- 0.5\rmax_acc \u0026lt;- 1\r### Analaysis of initial test\r# Prior accuracy of TT partitioners before initial test\rCorrect_proportions_initial \u0026lt;- runif(n=n_TT, min=min_acc,max=max_acc)\r It was recorded that only one participant returned 8 correct answers in the initial study. My Bayesian model used the binomial distribution with the arguments of 10 trials and prior probabilities. This model generated the posterior probability distribution given the data of Emily\u0026rsquo;s initial study. The average of the initial study was 4.67; thus I retrieved the posterior probability distribution of 5 from the Bayesian model.\nFigure 2: Bayes\n\rFigure 3: Posterior distribution\n\rAccording to the posterior probability distribution of the initial study, the probability of TT trainees returned more than 8 correct answers would be 0.018. Because Emily had never considered the reproduction of her initial study before the interview, the follow-up study was like the second chance for the TT trainees. After the initial study, Emily updated her assumption of how many correct answers TT trainees could return in this study. I used the posterior probability distribution of the initial study as the prior probabilities for the analysis of the follow-up study. Then I built the Bayesian model and retrieved the posterior probability distribution given the average 4.06, I truncated to 4.\nFigure 4: Bayesian inferece of follow-up study: Prior probability distribution (y axis) and Conditioning correct frequencies (x axis)\n\rFigure 5: Posterior probability distribution of follow-up study result\n\rThe histogram of the posterior probability distribution shows zero possibility beyond 8. My reanalysis indicates that Emily\u0026rsquo;s study indeed falsified the reality of Therapeutic Touch. You may wonder if people have updated the understanding of Therapeutic Touch because of Emily\u0026rsquo;s study. Till today the official website of Therapeutic Touch is regularly upgrading the latest information. More efforts are required to guide people thinking this world with scientific and statistical knowledge.\n","date":1534204800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534204800,"objectID":"bf3e947c9dbb038a5501a93b7a022235","permalink":"http://scchen.com/post/if-emily-rosa-met-thomas-bayes/","publishdate":"2018-08-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/if-emily-rosa-met-thomas-bayes/","section":"post","summary":"Reanalysis of the study conducted by a young girl two decades ago.

Richard is the evolutionary anthropologist at Max Planck Institute. He wrote this textbook for the PhD students who will use the Bayesian statistics in their research projects. Compared to the textbooks written by statisians and data scientistst, Richard‚Äôs book explain and demonstrate the statistical methods with examples instead of equations. His intention is to help who are not staticians but used to use statistics realize one fact: we rely on the statistical models as the representations of our answers rather than answer the questions by the raw data or naked truth. Many non-statisticians are used to find and learn what kind of methods or apps to deal with their data, but few are interested to know the models under the mentods and apps they are using. The trouble and danger is that they thought their jobs are done when the program printed the tables and figures but these outputs are from the statistical model is unable to answer their question. This situation is originated from many non-statisticans consider themselves the end-users of statistical models. Like any user of a packaged software, non-statisticans have no time to understand how the tools in their hands designed and conducted by statisticans.\nRichard introduced the story of golem to raise the non-statsiticans‚Äô attention to the troubles they had made and will make. A statistical model, like a golem, has the power beyond human to finish the work the human are unable to do, for example, trace the passengers‚Äô track from the trillion of camera. Its power could be misused or out of control if we do not understand what is the root of its action. A user of ststistical method, no matter you are or are not stistician, have to keep the awareness of engineer when you are dealing with your data. Today everyone has many easier ways than a decade ago to keep the awareness of engineer. One advantage is that the learning curve for being an part-time hacker is getting smooth. Increasing R apps are opening many windows for who are want to outlook and modify the statistical models.\nSince this post, every post listed in the category Rethinking is one of the summaries and feedbacks to Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan. At first I have to check my toolkits for create and manipulate the statistical models. They are R core and the packages. Years ago I have used to use the packages in my data processing. Now I show them for who start to use R after read this post.\ninstall.packages(c(\u0026quot;rpart\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;chron\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Hmisc\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Design\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Matrix\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;stringr\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;lme4\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;coda\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;e1071\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;zipfR\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;ape\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;languageR\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;multcomp\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;contrast\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shiny\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;ggplot2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;dplyr\u0026quot;))\rSome of the packages are learned from I participated in Cousera Data Science. Now I used to use dplyr to process the raw data, and I am learning how to draw the figures I need in use of ggplot2. When this post is published, I have updated my R to R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31).

Do a simulation work is the best way to understand the sampling distribution. A simulation work is unrelated to any context we collect the data. You can connect the simulation work to any randominzation in the real world.\nIn this pseudo experiment, there are only ten observations we will collect in every sample. They are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Accodring to the design of the experiment, a sample will have one observation to countless observations. I assume the distrubtions are accumulated from 100 samples of 1 observation, 9 observations, ,16 observations, 25 observations, and 36 observations. Every sample will be collapsed to a average value and become the components of sampling distribution. I use ggplot2 to draw the five sampling distributions. Look at what they are look like.\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\rlibrary(ggplot2)\rlibrary(xtable)\r})\rset.seed(1)\rOBV \u0026lt;- 1:10\rDist1 \u0026lt;- NULL\rDist9 \u0026lt;- NULL\rDist16 \u0026lt;- NULL\rDist25 \u0026lt;- NULL\rDist36 \u0026lt;- NULL\rcount = 100\rwhile(count \u0026gt; 0){Dist1 \u0026lt;- c(Dist1,sample(OBV, 1, replace = TRUE)); count \u0026lt;- count - 1}\rcount = 100\rwhile(count \u0026gt; 0){Dist9 \u0026lt;- c(Dist9,mean(sample(OBV, 9,replace = TRUE) ) ); count \u0026lt;- count - 1}\rcount = 100\rwhile(count \u0026gt; 0){Dist16 \u0026lt;- c(Dist16,mean(sample(OBV, 16,replace = TRUE) ) ); count \u0026lt;- count - 1}\rcount = 100\rwhile(count \u0026gt; 0){Dist25 \u0026lt;- c(Dist25,mean(sample(OBV, 25,replace = TRUE) ) ); count \u0026lt;- count - 1}\rcount = 100\rwhile(count \u0026gt; 0){Dist36 \u0026lt;- c(Dist36,mean(sample(OBV, 36,replace = TRUE) ) ); count \u0026lt;- count - 1}\rDist.df \u0026lt;- data.frame(Size = factor(rep(c(1,9,16,25,36), each=100)), Sample_Means = c(Dist1, Dist9, Dist16, Dist25, Dist36) )\rggplot(Dist.df, aes(Sample_Means, fill = Size)) + geom_histogram() + facet_grid(. ~ Size)\r We call the set of observations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 population in any circumstance we conduct this experiment. This population has the average 5.5 and the variance/standard deviation 8.25/2.87. With the increase of sample size, you find more and more samples collapsed to the average of population. The variation of each sample distribution decreases with the increasing of sample size as well. The following table illustrate the average and variance/standard deviation of each sampling distribution.\n   Sample Size Average Variance Standard Deviation     1 6.06 8.14 2.85   9 5.62 0.91 0.96   16 5.6 0.58 0.76   25 5.54 0.43 0.66   36 5.51 0.27 0.52    There are three findings in this simulation. First, the average of every sample is as equal as the average of population. Second, the variance of every sample is close to the divide of population variance by the sample size. Third, the standard deviation of every sample is close to the divide of population standard deviation by the square of sample size. These facts matches Central limit theorem.\n","date":1459296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1459296000,"objectID":"7f9d5cd721439cdc420ae863ef447c6b","permalink":"http://scchen.com/post/learning-sampling-distribution-in-r-programming/","publishdate":"2016-03-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/learning-sampling-distribution-in-r-programming/","section":"post","summary":"Visaulized random sampling","tags":["R programming","statistics"],"title":"Learning Sampling Distribution in R Programming","type":"post"},{"authors":["Sau-Chin Chen","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
