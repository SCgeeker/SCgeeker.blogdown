      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago 11-years-old Emily Rosa and her parents publsihed &lt;a href=&#34;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/187390&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;their study&lt;/a&gt; in Journal of the American Medical Association. This study was designed by Emily herself two years before the publication. Before 1998, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_touch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Therapeutic Touch&lt;/a&gt; (commonly shortened to &amp;ldquo;TT&amp;rdquo;) had been advocated in hundreds of hospitals and nursing schools in North America. Forty thousands of health care professionals had been trained to use TT for their patient. The trained TT professionals were claimed, by the promoters, have the skill to manipulate &lt;strong&gt;the energy field surrounded human body&lt;/strong&gt; without touching. TT professionals just stoped the plams above the patients&#39; body for minutes to cure their pain and anxiety. However, the evidence about the reality of TT was vague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;theraputic-touch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A TT therapist is healing a paitent.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily was curious how real was TT technique. To test their skill under unbiased observations, she designed the test table like the below figure shows. Every trainee would run 10 trials in one test. In each trial, Emily placed her right hand above one of the participated trainee&#39; hand, decided by flipped coin. She had the hypothesis if the skill of TT trainees was real, they would give the correct answers in at least 8 of the trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;joc71352f1.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Emily Rosa is testing her subjest.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily ran this study two times between 1996 and 1997. At the first time 15 TT trainees were invited to this study. She deiced to run the second time after the TV station interviewed her. At the second time 13 TT trainees, included 7 had participated in the first time, joined this study.  Their analysis showed the average accuracy of these trainees as equal to the random guessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mNoRxCRJ-Y0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would learn many things from Emily&amp;rsquo;s study till today. First of all the critical finding was the null effect. Today the behavioral scientists share more attention about the null effect than 1998. The other interesting thing is that the prediction could be verified by one point. It is rare to use the one-sample t-test in the psychological studies, but almost every psychologist learned the one-sample t-test before the independent t-test and paired t-test. Latest but may be critical, the idea of little Emily embodied the statistical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily&amp;rsquo;s data were summarized in the reproduced figure as below. They ran the one-sample t-test for the results of two times respectively. The analyses disconfirmed the reality of TT technique, but Emily and her parents might show a kind of researcher flexibility: they used the small samples in their first and follow-up studies. Could we upgrade their results in addition to conduct a registered replication plan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://scchen.com/post/if-emily-rosa-met-thomas-bayes/index_files/figure-html/Rosa1998Fig2-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Reproductive test results of Rosa et al.(1998)&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Figure 1: Reproductive test results of Rosa et al.(1998)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Emily had learned Bayesian statistics in 1998, she would show the reporters her stronger belief how fake the TT technique was. Next, I use the binomial probability distribution to reanalyze Emily&amp;rsquo;s data in the simple Bayesian inference. My first step is the recovery of the original correct frequency of every TT participant. Although Emily&amp;rsquo;s paper gave the range of scores (initial study: 2 to 8; follow-up study: 1 to 7), they did not provide the how many correct trials conducted by every participant. I arranged the numbers based on the averages and number of total correct responses as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(R-chunk, vectors of numbers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;# Initial test data
Data_initial &amp;lt;- c(2,3,3,3,3,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,7,8)
# Follow-up data
Data_followup &amp;lt;- c(1,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,7,7)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I required the theoretical parameters representing Emily&amp;rsquo;s hypothesis. Her study in nature was a game of coin tossing. She assumed certificated TT participants, given their technique was real, could answer correctly in more than 8 trials. In the other word, among the ten coins flipped by Emily, they could look into which 8, 9, or all sides on the top. Before the initial study, Emily could assume the probability each participant give the correct answer in a trial to be more than 0.5. If she used Bayesian inference, she would expect the posterior probability higher than 0.8. Therefore I prepared the uniform distribution ranged between 0.5 and 1 as the prior probability of the Bayesian inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;# Study parameters
n_TT &amp;lt;- 10000
n_trials &amp;lt;- 10

# Theoretical accuracies
min_acc &amp;lt;- 0.5
max_acc &amp;lt;- 1

### Analaysis of initial test

# Prior accuracy of TT partitioners before initial test
Correct_proportions_initial &amp;lt;- runif(n=n_TT, min=min_acc,max=max_acc)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was recorded that only one participant returned 8 correct answers in the initial study. My Bayesian model used the binomial distribution with the arguments of 10 trials and prior probabilities. This model generated the posterior probability distribution given the data of Emily&amp;rsquo;s initial study. The average of the initial study was 4.67; thus I retrieved the posterior probability distribution of 5 from the Bayesian model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!---

&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://scchen.com/post/if-emily-rosa-met-thomas-bayes/index_files/figure-html/Bayes-initial-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Bayes&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Figure 2: Bayes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://scchen.com/post/if-emily-rosa-met-thomas-bayes/index_files/figure-html/Post-initial-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Posterior distribution&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Figure 3: Posterior distribution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the posterior probability distribution of the initial study, the probability of TT trainees returned more than 8 correct answers would be &lt;code&gt;0.018&lt;/code&gt;. Because Emily had never considered the reproduction of her initial study before the interview, the follow-up study was like the second chance for the TT trainees. After the initial study, Emily updated her assumption of how many correct answers TT trainees could return in this study. I used the posterior probability distribution of the initial study as the prior probabilities for the analysis of the follow-up study. Then I built the Bayesian model and retrieved the posterior probability distribution given the average 4.06, I truncated to 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Figure 5: Posterior probability distribution of follow-up study result&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The histogram of the posterior probability distribution shows zero possibility beyond 8. My reanalysis indicates that Emily&amp;rsquo;s study indeed falsified the reality of Therapeutic Touch. You may wonder if people have updated the understanding of Therapeutic Touch because of Emily&amp;rsquo;s study. Till today &lt;a href=&#34;http://therapeutictouch.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the official website of Therapeutic Touch&lt;/a&gt; is regularly upgrading the latest information. More efforts are required to guide people thinking this world with scientific and statistical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since two weeks before I published this post, I have started read the book &lt;a href=&#34;http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/&#34;&gt;Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href=&#34;http://xcelab.net/rm/&#34;&gt;Richard McElreath&lt;/a&gt;. Richard is the evolutionary anthropologist at Max Planck Institute. He wrote this textbook for the PhD students who will use the Bayesian statistics in their research projects. Compared to the textbooks written by statisians and data scientistst, Richard’s book explain and demonstrate the statistical methods with examples instead of equations. His intention is to help who are not staticians but used to use statistics realize one fact: we rely on the statistical models as the representations of our answers rather than answer the questions by the raw data or naked truth. Many non-statisticians are used to find and learn what kind of methods or apps to deal with their data, but few are interested to know the models under the mentods and apps they are using. The trouble and danger is that they thought their jobs are done when the program printed the tables and figures but these outputs are from the statistical model is unable to answer their question. This situation is originated from many non-statisticans consider themselves the end-users of statistical models. Like any user of a packaged software, non-statisticans have no time to understand how the tools in their hands designed and conducted by statisticans.&lt;br /&gt;
Richard introduced the story of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem&#34;&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt; to raise the non-statsiticans’ attention to the troubles they had made and will make. A statistical model, like a golem, has the power beyond human to finish the work the human are unable to do, for example, trace the passengers’ track from the trillion of camera. Its power could be misused or out of control if we do not understand what is the root of its action. A user of ststistical method, no matter you are or are not stistician, have to keep the awareness of engineer when you are dealing with your data. Today everyone has many easier ways than a decade ago to keep the awareness of engineer. One advantage is that the learning curve for being an part-time hacker is getting smooth. Increasing R apps are opening many windows for who are want to outlook and modify the statistical models.&lt;br /&gt;
Since this post, every post listed in the category &lt;code&gt;Rethinking&lt;/code&gt; is one of the summaries and feedbacks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.crcpress.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-Stan/McElreath/9781482253443&#34;&gt;Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan&lt;/a&gt;. At first I have to check my toolkits for create and manipulate the statistical models. They are R core and the packages. Years ago I have used to use the packages in my data processing. Now I show them for who start to use R after read this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(c(&amp;quot;rpart&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;chron&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Hmisc&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Design&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Matrix&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;stringr&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;lme4&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;coda&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;e1071&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;zipfR&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;ape&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;languageR&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;multcomp&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;contrast&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shiny&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;ggplot2&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dplyr&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the packages are learned from I participated in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science&#34;&gt;Cousera Data Science&lt;/a&gt;. Now I used to use &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; to process the raw data, and I am learning how to draw the figures I need in use of &lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt;. When this post is published, I have updated my R to R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31). Through &lt;a href=&#34;http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/&#34;&gt;the codes of Heuristic Andrew&lt;/a&gt;, here are my installed packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ip &amp;lt;- as.data.frame(installed.packages()[,c(1,3:4)])
rownames(ip) &amp;lt;- NULL
ip &amp;lt;- ip[is.na(ip$Priority),1:2,drop=FALSE]

&lt;p&gt;Richard’s book inspired me help people control their golems/ststistical models in the process of coding. In his book, literature and codes are separated. Readers who are not familiar with coding skill might hardly follow his literature. Literatural coding might be the best way to impliment the &lt;code&gt;Rethinking&lt;/code&gt;. I am going to accumulating the codes of Bayesian statistics and thake notes of his and others literatures in the coming posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be many posts demostrate how to transfer the mathematical laws to the codes, and the reversed flaw. I start from this famous equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[ E = mc^2 \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the steps 1 and 2 indtroducted in &lt;a href=&#34;http://tinyheero.github.io/2015/12/06/rmd-to-jekyll-protect-eqn.html&#34;&gt;Fong Chun Chan’s post&lt;/a&gt;, my website is able to show the equation in any post. Because this theme use &lt;code&gt;kramdown&lt;/code&gt; as the engine of markdown, I pass the step 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the proof the central limitation theorem. Mix of inline and one-line equations.&lt;br /&gt;
We have a sequence of independent random variables,&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[ X_1, X_2, \ldots \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And the mean and variance of them:&lt;br /&gt;
Mean &lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[ E \left[{X_i}\right] = \mu \in \left({-\infty \,.\,.\, \infty}\right) \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Variance &lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[ V \left({X_i}\right) = \sigma^2 &amp;gt; 0 \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[ S_n = \sum_{i \mathop = 1}^n X_i \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Then:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[ \displaystyle \frac {S_n - n \mu} {\sqrt {n \sigma^2} } \xrightarrow {D} N \left({0, 1}\right)\]&lt;/span&gt; as &lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[ n \to \infty \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embedded tex codes in &lt;code&gt;$$ ... $$&lt;/code&gt;, the equation was transfered inline or in single line. Thus I pass the step 3 of &lt;a href=&#34;http://tinyheero.github.io/2015/12/06/rmd-to-jekyll-protect-eqn.html&#34;&gt;Fong Chun Chan’s method&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note.&lt;/strong&gt; Justify the last equation in 2021-05-13 20:51:38&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sampling distribution is the set of possible outcomes when we collect data through the randomization procedure (random sampling, ramond assignment). Do a simulation work is the best way to understand the sampling distribution. A simulation work is unrelated to any context we collect the data. You can connect the simulation work to any randominzation in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this pseudo experiment, there are only ten observations we will collect in every sample. They are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Accodring to the design of the experiment, a sample will have one observation to countless observations. I assume the distrubtions are accumulated from 100 samples of 1 observation, 9 observations, ,16 observations, 25 observations, and 36 observations. Every sample will be collapsed to a average value and become the components of sampling distribution. I use &lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt; to draw the five sampling distributions. Look at what they are look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(ggplot2)
  library(xtable)
  })

set.seed(1)
OBV &amp;lt;- 1:10
Dist1 &amp;lt;- NULL
Dist9 &amp;lt;- NULL
Dist16 &amp;lt;- NULL
Dist25 &amp;lt;- NULL
Dist36 &amp;lt;- NULL
count = 100
while(count &amp;gt; 0){Dist1 &amp;lt;- c(Dist1,sample(OBV, 1, replace = TRUE)); count &amp;lt;- count - 1}
count = 100
while(count &amp;gt; 0){Dist9 &amp;lt;- c(Dist9,mean(sample(OBV, 9,replace = TRUE) ) ); count &amp;lt;- count - 1}
count = 100
while(count &amp;gt; 0){Dist16 &amp;lt;- c(Dist16,mean(sample(OBV, 16,replace = TRUE) ) ); count &amp;lt;- count - 1}
count = 100
while(count &amp;gt; 0){Dist25 &amp;lt;- c(Dist25,mean(sample(OBV, 25,replace = TRUE) ) ); count &amp;lt;- count - 1}
count = 100
while(count &amp;gt; 0){Dist36 &amp;lt;- c(Dist36,mean(sample(OBV, 36,replace = TRUE) ) ); count &amp;lt;- count - 1}
Dist.df &amp;lt;- data.frame(Size = factor(rep(c(1,9,16,25,36), each=100)), Sample_Means = c(Dist1, Dist9, Dist16, Dist25, Dist36) )
ggplot(Dist.df, aes(Sample_Means, fill = Size)) + geom_histogram() + facet_grid(. ~ Size)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scchen.com/post/learning-sampling-distribution-in-r-programming/index_files/figure-html/Sampling-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call the set of observations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 &lt;strong&gt;population&lt;/strong&gt; in any circumstance we conduct this experiment. This population has the average 5.5 and the variance/standard deviation 8.25/2.87. With the increase of sample size, you find more and more samples collapsed to the average of population. The variation of each sample distribution decreases with the increasing of sample size as well. The following table illustrate the average and variance/standard deviation of each sampling distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Sample Size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Average&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Variance&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Standard Deviation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;6.06&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;8.14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;2.85&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;5.62&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;0.91&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;0.96&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;5.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;0.58&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;0.76&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;5.54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;0.43&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;0.66&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;5.51&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;0.27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;0.52&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three findings in this simulation. First, the average of every sample is as equal as the average of population. Second, the variance of every sample is close to the divide of population variance by the sample size. Third, the standard deviation of every sample is close to the divide of population standard deviation by the square of sample size. These facts matches &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Central limit theorem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
