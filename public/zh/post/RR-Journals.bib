  abstract = {The pre-registration of research via registered reports is a recent development in the field of psychology. The aim of pre-registration is to encourage research that presents sound hypotheses and methodology (Chambers, 2014) in order to counter undesirable but prevalent research practices such as cherry-picking and p-hacking. In this Letter from the Editors, we wish to echo calls for registered reports and outline how we, the Editors at the Journal of European Psychology Students (JEPS), plan to introduce registered reports for student research. We address the issues necessitating the introduction of registered reports and outline the approach needed for implementing this initiative in a student journal.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive Results in Social Psychology (CRSP) is a novel journal for preregistered research (so-called registered reports, RR) in the field of social psychology. It offers RR-only publications, with the possibility of adding exploratory analysis and data as well. After submission of introduction, hypotheses, methods, procedure, and analysis plan, submitted manuscripts are reviewed prior to data collection. If the peer review process results in a positive evaluation of the manuscript, an initial publication agreement (IPA) is issued upon which publication of the manuscript (given adherence to the registered protocol) independent of the obtained results is possible. CRSP seeks to complement the publication options in our field by making transparent confirmatory and exploratory research possible.},
