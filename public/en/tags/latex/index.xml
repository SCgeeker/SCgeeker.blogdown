      <description>There will be many posts demostrate how to transfer the mathematical laws to the codes, and the reversed flaw. I start from this famous equation:
\[ E = mc^2 \]
Use the steps 1 and 2 indtroducted in Fong Chun Chanâ€™s post, my website is able to show the equation in any post. Because this theme use kramdown as the engine of markdown, I pass the step 4.
Here are the proof the central limitation theorem.</description>

      <description>When a set of data/observations is imported to R, it is usually treated as vector. Vector has two mathematical forms as following:
column vector:
\[ \vec{a} = \begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\3\\\end{bmatrix} \]
row vector:
\[ \vec{a} = [ 1\ 2\ 3 ] \]
Default form of vector in R is column vector. More precisely, it is treated as a matrix:
a &amp;lt;- 1:3a## [1] 1 2 3class(a)## [1] &amp;quot;integer&amp;quot;str(a)## int [1:3] 1 2 3t(a)## [,1] [,2] [,3]## [1,] 1 2 3In a statistical work, we used to calcuate the sum of square (SS) for the deviations to mean.</description>
