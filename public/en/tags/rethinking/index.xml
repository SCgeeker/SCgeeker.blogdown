      <description>A bad caseA few days ago I was dealing with a raw data set as like the following table.
IDGroupI01I02I03I04I05I06s01A345123s02A253211s03A454311s04B215433s05B212521s06B233421This table is a tiny version I copied from a master graduate’s spss raw data table.</description>

      <description>To trace the fallacy of use hypothesis testing, I am programming the examples in Dr. Adrianus D. de Groot’s paper The meaning of “signiﬁcance” for different types of research. This paper is published in 1956 in the Dutch journal Nederlands Tijdschrift voor de Psychologie en Haar Grensgebieden. Adrianus De Groot is Dutch psychologist and chess master. During 1950s and 1960s, he suggested the concept of emperical cycle for the researchers who use the statistical tools in the social and behavioral researches.</description>

      <description>Chapter 2 of Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan introduces a water tossing example for the demonstration how Bayesain model run through the data based on the researcher’s hypothesis. This chapter defines a three stage process that are used in the coming chapters. We start from a narrated Data Story, then update the models by filling data in, and finally evaluate all the upated models. This literated process shows a clear picture for the learners who have yet stuied statistics before read this book.</description>

      <description>Since two weeks before I published this post, I have started read the book Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan written by Richard McElreath. Richard is the evolutionary anthropologist at Max Planck Institute. He wrote this textbook for the PhD students who will use the Bayesian statistics in their research projects. Compared to the textbooks written by statisians and data scientistst, Richard’s book explain and demonstrate the statistical methods with examples instead of equations.</description>
